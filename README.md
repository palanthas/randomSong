## Play a random song when triggered

## Requirements
ffmpeg

## Description
This was designed to work with an accessible button that shows up as a mouse click.

When triggered, the program will play the notification sound to let you know it detected the press and then select a random song from the music folder. The notification was added because some songs started quietly or might take a moment to select the song on a slower device.

Replace the contents of music and FX with your choice of audio files. MP3 was tested but any other standard audio file should work.
